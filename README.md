# Solving-System-of-Linear-Equations-in-Python


We can describe mathematically how the parts of a linear system relate to one another and to the input using a system of linear equations. If a linear system has n parts (where n is some number), then we can describe it with a system of n linear equations in n unknowns or variables. The unknowns in these equations are the values of the inputs. If we did the analysis correctly then there will be a unique solution for the values of the inputs.

Here is an example of a system of two linear equations in the two unknowns x and y:
